| Requirement ID | Solution Options | Pros | Cons | Chosen Solution & Justification |
|----------------|-----------------|------|------|--------------------------------|
| SR-06 TLS 1.3 | (a) Use reverse proxy (Nginx/Caddy) with TLS1.3 enforced, HSTS, headers <br> (b) Application-level TLS handling | (a) Centralized, mature, easy config; reusable across services <br> (b) Direct control per app | (a) Adds infra dependency <br> (b) Harder to configure consistently | **(a) Reverse proxy with TLS1.3 + headers — industry standard, minimal overhead, consistent security |
| SR-13 Session timeout | (a) JWT with short TTL (15 min) + frontend idle timer <br> (b) Server-managed sessions with DB expiry | (a) Stateless, scalable, easy invalidation with exp claim <br> (b) Fine-grained control, easy manual invalidation | (a) Tokens can’t be revoked before expiry <br> (b) DB overhead, less scalable | (a) JWT short TTL + idle timer — balances security & scalability |
| SR-11 Ballot validation | (a) JSON Schema validation + server-side checks <br> (b) Custom validation logic only | (a) Standardized, reusable, easy to test <br> (b) Flexible | (a) Learning curve for schema <br> (b) Error-prone, hard to maintain | **(a) JSON Schema + server checks** — ensures consistency + security against malformed ballots |
| SR-02 Address update + audit | (a) PUT endpoint with ETag/If-Match concurrency + immutable audit log <br> (b) Basic update without concurrency/audit | (a) Prevents race conditions, provides accountability <br> (b) Simple, fast | (a) More dev effort <br> (b) Security gaps (lost updates, no audit trail) | **(a) ETag + audit logic — ensures integrity, accountability, compliance readiness |
| SR-20 Results API | (a) Authenticated GET /results with checksum header (SHA-256) + caching <br> (b) Open GET endpoint without checksum | (a) Integrity check, protected access, reduces bandwidth via caching <br> (b) Simple, quick | (a) Slight overhead (auth, checksum) <br> (b) Risk of tampering, replay | **(a) Authenticated + checksum + caching — ensures result authenticity + efficient distribution |
